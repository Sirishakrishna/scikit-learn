There are many libraries for extending the functionality of Python.

SciKit-Learn was created specifically for building predictive models.

Predictive modeling is focused on building accurate models without regard to how they are built. 

In machine learning column names are called features. 

The rows are called observations.

The feature we are trying to predict is called a target variable. 

Choosing what columns or features to use in the modeling process is called feature selection.
